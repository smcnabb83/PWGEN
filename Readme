This password generator does not generate strong passwords. It is used to generate passwords that are simple for people to remember
that are not quite as bad as "password1." As such, these passwords should NEVER be used for regulating access to sensitive systems.
Instead, the use cases for these are primarily granting workers simple access to devices with limited permissions.
